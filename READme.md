## Overview
The world is a big, scary place, especially for those of us who believe in the supernatural. We at Squatch Watch look to alleviate that fear by giving our users a way to track the cryptids before they track us.
The Squatch Watch app allows its patrons to share picture and stories of their close encounters, as well as rate other users' stories.

## Technologies
1. Mongo/mongoose
2. Express (and async handler)
3. React
4. Node.js
5. JSON Webtoken Validation for User Authentication
6. Canva for wireframe/design
7. Axios for request handling

## Features
The initial web app is a very basic blog app. Patrons will be able to:
- create a username with a password
- post a text post with pictures
- upvote and downvote other accounts
- view their own gallery of posts
- delete and update their own posts

However, there is a lot of room for scalability:
### Stretch Goals
- A map that uses the coordinates from the posts to show where different cryptids have been sighted.
- Specific searches for certain cryptids

## What we learned
- a lot about encryption and protection
- working in github with a team, allotment of jobs, etc (it was our first group project)
